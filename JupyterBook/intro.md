# About the Image Annotation Workbench

Image Annotation Workbench provides a workflow for annotation & publishing of International Image Interoperability Framework (IIIF) images across institutional repositories. Annotations can combine semantic tags from domain specific vocabularies with critical analysis references. Researchers can collaborate and publish the annotated images as research outputs.
