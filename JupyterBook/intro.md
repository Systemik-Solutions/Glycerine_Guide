# About the Glycerine Image Annotation Workbench

Glycerine Image Annotation Workbench provides a workflow for annotation & publishing of International Image Interoperability Framework (IIIF) images across institutional repositories. Annotations can combine semantic tags from domain specific vocabularies with critical analysis references. Researchers can collaborate and publish the annotated images as research outputs.

As a Glycerine user, you will create a collection of image sets made up of either your own images or images hosted in external repositories. You'll then create sets of annotations on those image sets that can be published as your own scholarship. You can share your collections with your colleagues, who can then create their own annotation sets that they can also publish.

Follow our guides for instructions on the following workflows:
- **Create a Collection** – Creating a new research collection, to which you can add image sets for annotation.
- **Collaboration** – Sharing collections and collaborating with colleagues.
- **Image Set** – Adding images to collections manually or by searching existing repositories.
- **Annotation** – Outlining components and annotating them with tags, notes, and links.
- **Publishing** – Sharing an annotated image as a research output.
