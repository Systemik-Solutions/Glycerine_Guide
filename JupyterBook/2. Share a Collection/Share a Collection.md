# Share a Collection

Once you have created a Collection, you can share it with other people so they can add their own Image Sets and annotate them. They can also annotate any Image Sets that you’ve added. But don’t worry—they can’t delete any of your Image Sets. They also can’t share the Collection with others themselves.

1.	Press **Share**.
2.	Enter someone’s email address (they don’t need to already be an Image Annotation Workbench user).
3.	Press **Share**.

They will receive an invitation to join the Collection.

Under **Users**, you can also press the **x** button to remove users you’ve already shared with.
