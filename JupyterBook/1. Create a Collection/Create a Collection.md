# Create a Collection

The first time you use the Image Annotation Workbench, you will need to create a Collection. Collections hold Image Sets within them, so you can create different Collections to group certain Image Sets.

1.	In the sidebar, click **Add Collection**.
2.	Give the Collection a **Name** and **Description**.
3.	Press **Create**.

Now you can [share the Collection with others](https://systemik-solutions.github.io/Glycerine_Guide/2.%20Share%20a%20Collection/Share%20a%20Collection.html), [add Image Sets to the Collection](https://systemik-solutions.github.io/Glycerine_Guide/3.%20Create%20an%20Image%20Set/Create%20an%20Image%20Set.html#create-an-image-set), and [annotate those Image Sets](https://systemik-solutions.github.io/Glycerine_Guide/4.%20Annotate%20an%20Image%20Set/Annotate%20an%20Image%20Set.html).
