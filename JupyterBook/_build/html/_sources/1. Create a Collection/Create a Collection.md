# Create a Collection

The first time you use the Image Annotation Workbench, you will need to create a Collection. Collections hold Image Sets within them, so you can create different Collections to group certain Image Sets.

1.	In the sidebar, click Add Collection.
2.	Give the Collection a Name and Description.
3.	Press Create.

Now you can Share the Collection with others, add Image Sets to the Collection, and annotate those Image Sets.
