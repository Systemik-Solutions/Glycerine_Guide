# Annotate an Image Set

Once you have created an Image Set, you can annotate it. To add annotations to an Image Set you must create an Annotation Set for it. Anybody can add an Annotation Set to an Image Set [if the Collection has been shared with them](https://systemik-solutions.github.io/image_annotation_site/2.%20Share%20a%20Collection/Share%20a%20Collection.html).

## Create an Annotation Set

1.	Click the three dots next to the Image Set you want to annotate.
2.	Click **Annotate**.
3.	Press **Add Annotation Set**.
4.	Give the Annotation Set a **Name** and **Description**.
5.	Press **Select Vocabulary** to set a default vocabulary from Research Vocabularies Australia to use for tagging in annotations.
6.	Press **Create**.

Now you are ready to annotate.

## Annotate

1.	Next to the Annotation Set you want to use, press the **Annotate** button.
2.	At the top of the page, choose your desired annotation tool and draw a shape.

You can use any combination of these five tools to draw on your image and create annotations.

#### Freehand tool

Click these icons to use the oval or circle tools. Click and drag your mouse on the image to draw an oval or circle of any size. When you release the mouse button, the drawing will complete, and the annotation pane will appear.

#### Rectangle tool

3.	In the **About** tab, give your annotation a **Title**, **Description**, and add any relevant **Links** (press the plus button to add more than one).
4.	In the **Tags** tab, use terms from a Research Vocabularies Australia vocabulary to tag the annotation. You can chose from **Published** or **Sandpit** (work-in-progress) vocabularies. Once you selected one, you can press **Switch Vocabulary** at any time to choose another.
5.	In the **Notes** tab, add **Notes** (press the plus button to add more than one), an **Attribution**, a **Date**, and set the **Line Color**.

> **Notes** can be anything you like — maybe detailed descriptions of the part of the image being annotated, or quotes from other scholars.
Each annotation can only have one **Attribution** and **Date**. These will usually be your name and the current date.
Different **Line Colors** are useful for grouping annotations. For instance, you might choose **Dark** for a large annotation, then **Medium** or **Light** for annotations of things within that larger area.

6.	When you’re done, click **Save**.
7.	If there are multiple images in the Image Set, click their thumbnails to start annotating them.
