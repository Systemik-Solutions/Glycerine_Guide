# Annotate an Image Set

Once you have created an Image Set, you can annotate it. Before you start annotating, think about the kinds of information you want to include in the annotation. You can adjust the fields that can be filled out in the annotation window by creating custom **Annotation Templates**. If you're okay with basic fields like Title, Description, Links, and Notes, you can skip straight to [creating an annotation set](https://systemik-solutions.github.io/Glycerine_Guide/4.%20Annotate%20an%20Image%20Set/Annotate%20an%20Image%20Set.html#create-an-annotation-set).

## Create a custom Annotation Template

If our preset Standard, Basic, and Minimal Annotation Templates don't offer the fields you need for your annotations, create a custom template.

1. In the sidebar go to **Management** > **Annotation Templates**.
2. Click **Create New**.
3. Give your template a **Name** and **Description**
4. Click **Add Field** to add a new field to the template. You can also click **Create Group** to group fields together.

> Fields in the same Group will show in their own tab in the [Annotation Window](https://systemik-solutions.github.io/Glycerine_Guide/4.%20Annotate%20an%20Image%20Set/Annotate%20an%20Image%20Set.html#the-annotation-window). The name of the Group is the name of the tab.

5. Choose the field **Type** from the dropdown.

> The **Long Text** type has the option to allow HTML customisation, while the **Text** type does not.

6. Give the field a **Name** and **Description**. If you have chosen the **Choice** Type, you will also need to add options to the **Option List**. Separate each option with a new line.
7. Use the checkboxes to set options for the field.
8. Click **Create**.
9. Once you've added all the fields you want, you can also set a **Title Mask** to determine the title of all annotations that use this template. The mask can incorporate values from other fields in the template.
10. Click **Save**.

With your template finished you can now proceed to annotation.

## Create an Annotation Set

To add annotations to an Image Set you must create an Annotation Set for it. Anybody can add an Annotation Set to an Image Set [if the Collection has been shared with them](https://systemik-solutions.github.io/Glycerine_Guide/2.%20Share%20a%20Collection/Share%20a%20Collection.html#share-a-collection).

1.	Click the three dots next to the Image Set you want to annotate.
2.	Click **Annotate**.
3.	Press **Add Annotation Set**.
4.	Give the Annotation Set a **Name** and **Description**.
5.	Press **Select Vocabulary** to set a default vocabulary from Research Vocabularies Australia to use for tagging in annotations.
6.	Press **Create**.

Now you're ready to annotate.

## Annotate

1.	Next to the Annotation Set you want to use, press the **Annotate** button.
2.	At the top of the page, choose your desired annotation tool and draw a shape.

### Annotation tools

You can use any combination of these five tools to draw on your image and create annotations.

#### Freehand tool

Click this icon to use the freehand tool. Click and drag your mouse on the image to draw any line or shape. When you release the mouse button, the drawing will complete, and the annotation pane will appear.

#### Oval and circle tools

Click these icons to use the oval or circle tools. Click and drag your mouse on the image to draw an oval or circle of any size. When you release the mouse button, the drawing will complete, and the annotation pane will appear.

#### Rectangle tool

Click this icon to use the rectangle tool. Click and drag your mouse on the image to draw a rectangle of any size. When you release the mouse button, the drawing will complete, and the annotation pane will appear.

#### Polygon tool

<img width="58" height="58" alt="Polygon tool" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/d3289d76-aefc-4c50-ad61-4fa7fbcccd93" />

Click this icon to use the polygon tool. Click and drag your mouse to draw the first line in a polygon. When you release the mouse button, the straight line will be drawn. You can then click your mouse anywhere on the image to place the next line in the polygon. Repeat this as many times as you want. Double-click to close the shape and complete the drawing. The annotation window will appear.

### The annotation window

You can fill out the information for your annotation in the annotation window. At the top of the window select your desired **Annotation Template** to adjust the fields you're filling out. You can choose from **Standard**, **Basic**, **Minimal**, or any custom template you've built. You can also switch between **Annotation Languages** if you have [added other languages to your Image Set](https://systemik-solutions.github.io/Glycerine_Guide/3.%20Create%20an%20Image%20Set/Create%20an%20Image%20Set.html#manually-create-an-image-set).

1.	In the **About** tab, give your annotation a **Title**, **Description**, and add any relevant **Links** (press the plus button to add more than one).
2.	In the **Notes** tab, add **Notes** (press the plus button to add more than one), an **Attribution**, a **Date**, and set the **Line Color**.
3.	In the **Tags** tab, use terms from a Research Vocabularies Australia vocabulary to tag the annotation. You can chose from **Published** or **Sandpit** (work-in-progress) vocabularies. Once you selected one, you can press **Switch Vocabulary** at any time to choose another.

> **Notes** can be anything you like — maybe detailed descriptions of the part of the image being annotated, or quotes from other scholars.
Each annotation can only have one **Attribution** and **Date**. These will usually be your name and the current date.
Different **Line Colors** are useful for grouping annotations. For instance, you might choose **Dark** for a large annotation, then **Medium** or **Light** for annotations of things within that larger area.

4.	When you’re done, click **Save**.

If there are multiple images in the Image Set, click their thumbnails to start annotating them.
