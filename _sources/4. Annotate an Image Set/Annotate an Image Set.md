# Annotate an Image Set

Once you have created an Image Set, you can annotate it. To add annotations to an Image Set you must create an Annotation Set for it. Anybody can add an Annotation Set to an Image Set [if the Collection has been shared with them](https://systemik-solutions.github.io/image_annotation_site/2.%20Share%20a%20Collection/Share%20a%20Collection.html).

## Create an Annotation Set

1.	Click the three dots next to the Image Set you want to annotate.
2.	Click **Annotate**.
3.	Press **Add Annotation Set**.
4.	Give the Annotation Set a **Name** and **Description**.
5.	Press **Select Vocabulary** to set a default vocabulary from Research Vocabularies Australia to use for tagging in annotations.
6.	Press **Create**.

Now you are ready to annotate.

## Annotate

1.	Next to the Annotation Set you want to use, press the **Annotate** button.
2.	At the top of the page, choose your desired annotation tool and draw a shape.

### The annotation window

You can fill out the information for your annotation in the annotation window. At the top of the window select your desired **Annotation Template** to adjust the fields you're filling out. You can choose from **Standard**, **Basic**, **Minimal**, or any custom template you've built. You can also switch between **Annotation Languages** if you have [added other languages to your Image Set](https://systemik-solutions.github.io/Glycerine_Guide/3.%20Create%20an%20Image%20Set/Create%20an%20Image%20Set.html#manually-create-an-image-set).

1.	In the **About** tab, give your annotation a **Title**, **Description**, and add any relevant **Links** (press the plus button to add more than one).
2.	In the **Notes** tab, add **Notes** (press the plus button to add more than one), an **Attribution**, a **Date**, and set the **Line Color**.
3.	In the **Tags** tab, use terms from a Research Vocabularies Australia vocabulary to tag the annotation. You can chose from **Published** or **Sandpit** (work-in-progress) vocabularies. Once you selected one, you can press **Switch Vocabulary** at any time to choose another.

> **Notes** can be anything you like — maybe detailed descriptions of the part of the image being annotated, or quotes from other scholars.
Each annotation can only have one **Attribution** and **Date**. These will usually be your name and the current date.
Different **Line Colors** are useful for grouping annotations. For instance, you might choose **Dark** for a large annotation, then **Medium** or **Light** for annotations of things within that larger area.

4.	When you’re done, click **Save**.

If there are multiple images in the Image Set, click their thumbnails to start annotating them.
