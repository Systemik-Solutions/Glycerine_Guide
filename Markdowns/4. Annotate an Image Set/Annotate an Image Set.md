# Annotate an Image Set

Once you have created an Image Set, you can annotate it. To add annotations to an Image Set you must create an Annotation Set for it. Anybody can add an Annotation Set to an Image Set if the Collection has been shared with them.

## Create an Annotation Set
1.	Press the three dots next to the Image Set you want to annotate.
2.	Click Annotate.
3.	Press Add Annotation Set.
4.	Give the Annotation Set a Name and Description.
5.	Press Select Vocabulary to set a default vocabulary from Research Vocabularies Australia to use for tagging in annotations.
6.	Press Create.

Now you are ready to annotate.

## Annotate
1.	Next to the Annotation Set you want to use, press the Annotate button.
2.	At the top of the page, choose your desired annotation tool and draw a shape.

### Annotation tools
 
You can use any combination of these six tools to draw on your image and create annotations.
Freehand tool
 
Click this icon to use the freehand tool. Click and drag your mouse on the image to draw any line or shape. When you release the mouse button, the drawing will complete, and the annotation pane will appear.
Oval and circle tools
  
Click these icons to use the oval or circle tools. Click and drag your mouse on the image to draw an oval or circle of any size. When you release the mouse button, the drawing will complete, and the annotation pane will appear.
Point tool
 
Click this icon to use the point tool. Click anywhere on the image to place a single point. The annotation pane will appear.
Rectangle tool
 
Click this icon to use the rectangle tool. Click and drag your mouse on the image to draw a rectangle of any size. When you release the mouse button, the drawing will complete, and the annotation pane will appear.
Polygon tool
 
Click this icon to use the polygon tool. Click and drag your mouse to draw the first line in a polygon. When you release the mouse button, the straight line will be drawn. You can then click your mouse anywhere on the image to place the next line in the polygon. Repeat this as many times as you want. Double-click to close the shape and complete the drawing. The annotation pane will appear.


3.	In the About tab, give your annotation a Title, Description, and add any relevant Links (press the plus button to add more than one).
4.	In the Tags tab, use terms from a Research Vocabularies Australia vocabulary to tag the annotation. You can press Switch Vocabulary at any time.
5.	In the Notes tab, add Notes (press the plus button to add more than one), an Attribution, a Date, and set the Line Color.

Notes can be anything you like — maybe detailed descriptions of the part of the image being annotated, or quotes from other scholars.

Each annotation can only have one Attribution and Date. These will usually be your name and the current date.

Different Line Colors are useful for grouping annotations. For instance, you might choose Dark for a large annotation, then Medium or Light for annotations of things within that larger area.

6.	When you’re done, click Save.
7.	If there are multiple images in the Image Set, click their thumbnails to start annotating them.
