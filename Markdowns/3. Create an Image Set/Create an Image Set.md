# Create an Image Set

Once you have created a Collection, you can add Image Sets to it to annotate. You can create an Image Set manually, or you can import an existing one from an external institution, like a database or archive.

## Manually create an Image Set 

1.	Press **Add Image Set**.
2.	Give the Image Set a **Name**, a **Description**, an **Attribution**, and add or remove any **Annotation Languages** you would like to be able to use for annotations.
3.	To add **Images**, press **Upload Local Image**, **Add Remote Image**, or **Add IIIF Image**.
4.	Give the image a **Name** and a **Description**, add your chosen image, and press **Add**.
5.	Add as many images to the Image Set as you want.

## Import an Image Set from an institution

Currently, this feature of the Image Annotation Workbench is integrated with the following institutions:

â€¢	Public Record Office Victoria (PROV)

1.	Press **Import from Institution**.
2.	Use the available fields to conduct a search for images.
3.	Use the checkboxes to select any images you want to add as Image Sets. They will be added as individual Image Sets.
4.	Above the search results, press **Add selections to collection**.

Now you are ready to begin annotating the images in your Image Set.
