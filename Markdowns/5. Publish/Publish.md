# Publish

There are two steps to publishing in the Image Annotation Workbench. First, publish the Image Set. Then, publish individual Annotation Sets so they can be seen on the public Image Set.

## 1. Publish an Image Set

You can only publish Image Sets that you have created yourself.

1.	Click the three dots next to the Image Set you want to publish.
2.	Click **Publish**.
3.	Press **Yes** in the popup if you want to proceed.

Your Image Set can now be shared with others via the **Public URL**. To find this, press the three dots again and press **Public URL**.

You can also press **Unpublish** at any time.

## 2. Publish Annotation Sets

You can only publish Annotation Sets that you have created yourself.

1.	Click the three dots next to the Image Set you want to publish annotations for.
2.	Click **Annotate**.
3.	Next to the Annotation Set you want to publish, press the **Publish** button.
4.	Press **Yes** in the popup if you want to proceed.

Your Annotation Set can now be seen on the Image Set via the **Public URL**.

> Once you've published your annotation set you can also press the **Share** icon next to the set to find the IIIF Annotation Collection Manifest, which contains the annotation data only. You can open this in other IIIF annotation platforms.
